    <h1>Virgil van Dijk</h1>

    <p><strong>Virgil van Dijk</strong> is a right-footed centre-back, who usually features on the left-hand side of central defence, although he can also play as a right-sided centre-back. Neil McGuinness, senior scout at Celtic when Van Dijk was signed, called him "everything you would want if you could create a profile of the <b>ideal central defender</b>", praising him as a "very smooth ball-playing defender" who possesses aerial prowess, skills from dead ball situations, and "strong  <i><u>leadership</u></i> qualities", while commenting that since his move to England, he is "more tactically aware now. His anticipation and timing has improved and he is a lot more of an all-rounder". McGuinness believes Van Dijk's "biggest problem" is that he "can switch off when the game is comfortable".</p>
